# Fresh X Mind Wordpress Starter Theme

FreshXMind is a Wordpress theme boilerplate or starter project, to help you quickly kickstart custom themes. Actively maintained and in constant development to ensure compliance with all the latest Wordpress standards and guidelines.

## Features

- **Gutenberg** ready theme
- **Customizer API** extends, ready with commonly used **theme options** configurations
  - Custom Color settings
  - Logos
- Hot reloading during development using **Webpack**
- Built in workflow for **SCSS** and **Modern JavaScript ES6+**
- Built in commonly used PHP **helper functions**
- Awesome `functions.php` workflow with Classes and a clear folder structure
- **Theme Hooks** and **custom actions** makes this super easy to customize **template-parts** while keeping template files super clean. Simply __plug in__ your template-parts to the corresponding functions and actions, see the `header.php` and `footer.php` for examples.
- This (^) makes it extendable and compatible with child themes too
- Code linting
- So many other features, docs under construction

## Dependencies

- PHP 7+
- Node 8+
- NPM 5+
- Yarn
- ACF PRO Wordpress Plugin (Non ACF version incoming)

Note: We're not including the ACF plugin, you'll need your own license to use it.

## Installation

Clone repo into your `wp-content/themes` folder and run

- `yarn install`

If you'd like to use `npm` instead of `Yarn`, simply delete the `yarn.lock` in the root folder and run `npm install` instead.

### Run Webpack dev server with live reload

- `npm run start`

### Compile assets for production

- `npm run build` (To do here add CI, deployment, etc).

## Folder/Theme Structure

Here's a quick overview and walkthrough of how the theme's organized and the folder structure. **Look at `functions.php` and the `/inc/` folder**

### Main Workflow

Theme's templates (i.e [header.php](header.php)) execute **action hooks** _(`do_action()`)_. These are located here: [Theme Hooks](inc/core/theme-hooks.php).

The **hooked actions** and their corresponding **functions** are **registered** as [template-parts](inc/template-parts.php). _Might rename this for clearer convention_

These functions fetch data if needed, and **render partials** _or template-parts_ using `get_template_part()`. See the [Header Action Functions](inc/template-parts/header.php) for a working example.

Why do it like this instead of just calling the `get_template_part()` directly from the template files?

- Super easy to override/extend the theme by hooking into the right action from a child theme/plugin
- Keeps templates super clean and easy to read, maintain and update to fit custom needs
- Makes this a starter theme, potentially easy to extend into a stand-alone, white-label, generic solution

**This is the way.**

<!-- Note: For super simple projects, you could simply do `get_template_part()` functions directly from your templates, or just throw all that messy code in that single file _(yikes)_. -->

### Styles

- `Abstracts`: Variables, functions, mixins, helpers. A good way to see this is, it should not print out any CSS code if compiled on it's own.
- `Base`: Settings, tools and helpers. Contains global styles, normalizers and utility classes.
- `Blocks`: Styles specific to blocks like the header, footer, or any full width section.
- `Components`: Styles specific to components like buttons, tooltips, and other small stand-alone reusable pieces.
- `Layout`: For things specific to the website's layout and formatting, global styles. Things specific to the theme either in FE or admin.
- `Pages`: Styles specific to pages like the home page
- `Helpers`: Overrides to colors classes and spacings, etc.

## Theme Customization

The `fxm` prefix can be changed by running a search and replace on the theme's folder and replacing it for your desired prefix/theme-domain.

## Debugging

Make sure to add the following at the bottom of your `wp-config.php` file:

```php
define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );
define( 'WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', true );
define( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', true );
```

_this enables the creation and population of a `debug.log` file in your `wp-content` directory (look at the helper functions in `/inc/common/helper-functions.php` if curious on further implementation)_
